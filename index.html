We have know each other since 2009, but OUR story began as long conversations late at night(in the AM's to be specific) in the year 2020. We talked about everything there was to talk about. The texts eventually became long voice notes that I looked forward to and then, you became a sister, a bestfriend,  basically the love of my life.</p>

<p>I swear God was sipping hot chocolate when He got us closer!  He sure cooked!  I loved you yesterday, I love you today and I will still love you tomorrow till forever! This is a forever thing and you're stuck with me Gorgeous.  If I had the power, be ke tlo go fa Earth as a 21st birthday gift and everyone a relocater ga monate jwang, but ba re Mars asencho e be le dintlo and stuff, but I'm working on it!  I Hope you planned something for this big day! Enjoy your day! Once again,  Happy 21st Birthday babby!</p>

<p>From your well wisher, Matome!</p>
